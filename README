Usage:

amz.py Foo.amz

Do this from the directory you wish the files to end up, files will be
downloaded into Artist/Album folders.

NOTE: This only works on plaintext (non-encrypted) AMZ files. If you
download an AMZ file and it doesn't work, you will have to use Clamz
instead. Clamz can be found at:
